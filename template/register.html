                                        <p>What is Lorem Ipsum?
                                            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                                            Lorem
                                            Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when
                                            an
                                            unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                                            specimen book.
                                            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                                            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                                            1960s with
                                            the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more
                                            recently
                                            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
                                            Lorem
                                            Ipsum.

                                            Why do we use it?
                                            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
                                            readable
                                            content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
                                            is that
                                            it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                                            'Content
                                            here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                                            publishing
                                            packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
                                            text, and a
                                            search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                                            Various
                                            versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
                                            purpose
                                            (injected humour and the like).


                                            Where does it come from?
                                            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
                                            roots in a
                                            piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
                                            old.
                                            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                                            looked
                                            up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
                                            passage, and
                                            going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                                            undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of
                                            "de
                                            Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero,
                                            written in 45
                                            BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
                                            Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
                                            comes
                                            from a line in section 1.10.32.

                                            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
                                            for those
                                            interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
                                            Malorum" by
                                            Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by
                                            English
                                            versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

                                            Where can I get some?
                                            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
                                            majority
                                            have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised
                                            words which
                                            don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of
                                            Lorem
                                            Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the
                                            middle of
                                            text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
                                            predefined
                                            chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
                                            It uses a
                                            dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                                            sentence
                                            structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
                                            Lorem
                                            Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                                            non-characteristic words etc.</p>
